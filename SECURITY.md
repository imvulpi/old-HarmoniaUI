# Reporting security vulnerabilities

Do NOT create an issue on Github as it will be seen publicly

Report Vulnerabilities through our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rgsGFsGQsg). 
Write to the Server owner or Administrators, don't disclose the vulnerability unless speaking privately with the Administrators or preferably owner in either a private channel or private messages.
