‚ö† PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING ‚ö†

This library is in early development, and hasn't been thoroughly checked on all platforms.
<br>I suggest downloading the library and testing it for yourself on a seperate project, it might be something you would want to follow, or contribute to üòÅ

‚ùó You should download the most recent branch to get the latest version. 

# HarmoniaUI
HarmoniaUI is a library for Godot engine designed to simplify UI creation and extend the UI possibilities.

Our library tries to implement well known and liked aspects of different UI libraries, styling languages like CSS or web engines.
It mainly uses Godot C++ GDExtension to make the UI and to steer it, obviously with its own implementation. 

The UI works with basic Godot control nodes and if some kind of migration is needed then control nodes can be converted to containers.

- Buttons:
  - Button [PLAY]
  - CheckButton [X][O]
  - ToogleButton [ O -text-  ]
  - SelectButton [ -text- \\/ ]

BUTTONS
(These would actually be a type of container with specific events and other functionalities)

Buttons(all):
  - Disabled (Y/N)

Buttons:
  Button:
     - Text
  CheckInput:
     - "Check" image
     - Text
  Toggle:
     - "Toggle" image
     - Text
  SelectButton:
     - "Dropdown" image
     - List Order (flip)
     - List elements container attributes
     - Possiblity of making the list a ListBox instead.

  - Type (number, text, date, (regex - to discuss))
  - Multiline (Y/N)
  - Placeholder text

Text:
  - Scroll (from container - to discuss)
  - Multiline (Y/N)

Besides these an API for each of them would be there for interacting with the object and objects inside them, you can create your own containers and stuff.
Definely events like press, input, hover etc.

\* There is definely a lot missing from the plans for future, I didn't write all of the functionalities that are desired.
\** Not sure if ListBox will be created, because of flexbox being very similiar and extending the listbox possibilities.
